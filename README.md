**Overview:**
This project involves analyzing an eCommerce Transactions dataset to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), develop a Lookalike Model, and conduct Customer Segmentation through clustering techniques. The analysis aims to derive actionable business insights and enhance customer understanding.

**Repository Structure**
The repository contains the following files:

**Data Files**
Customers.csv: Contains customer information including CustomerID, CustomerName, Region, and SignupDate.
Products.csv: Includes product details such as ProductID, ProductName, Category, and Price.
Transactions.csv: Records transaction data with fields like TransactionID, CustomerID, ProductID, TransactionDate, Quantity, TotalValue, and Price.

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
FirstName_LastName_EDA.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing the EDA code.
FirstName_LastName_EDA.pdf: PDF report summarizing the business insights derived from the EDA.

**Lookalike Model**
FirstName_LastName_Lookalike.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook detailing the development of the Lookalike Model.
FirstName_LastName_Lookalike.csv: CSV file listing the top 3 lookalike customers with their similarity scores for the first 20 customers.

**Customer Segmentation / Clustering**
FirstName_LastName_Clustering.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook presenting the clustering analysis and results.
FirstName_LastName_Clustering.pdf: PDF report discussing the clustering outcomes, including the number of clusters formed and relevant metrics.

**Results**
The analysis provides insights into customer behavior, product performance, and transaction trends. The Lookalike Model recommends similar customers based on profile and transaction history, while the clustering analysis segments customers into distinct groups for targeted strategies.
